# Unity "Mind" Spiking Neural Network Simulation

WIP: Simulation and visualization of spiking neural network in Unity, with spiking and spike-timing dependent plasticity logic written in HLSL (see [Compute Shader](https://github.com/puddleglum56/mind/blob/main/Assets/Resources/ComputeShader.compute)) and managed in C# (see [Manager](https://github.com/puddleglum56/mind/blob/main/Assets/Manager.cs))

3D graph visualization largely borrowed from: https://github.com/mdaquin/3d_graph_layout_unity
